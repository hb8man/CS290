1. Apple.com is very pretty, displays information and animates / transitions as you scroll and is very minimalistic. Github is an excellent website, runs extremely well, and has a well thought out UI. Youtube is also an example of a well designed website. Instagram also has a nice UI, and runs quite well. The fintech company Stripe has a very pretty website with background gradient animations and scrolling text / image transitions, very smooth.

2. https://www.apple.com, I would add more animations, possibly background animations, needs more color. I'm not sure what I would change about github.com. With Youtube, I would get rid of shorts and also allow the users to have more control over what content is reccommended to them. For Instagram, I would make the UI wider, as it still caters to a more mobile like format even on the desktop site. Stripe's website is perfect, needs no change.
